            <h2>Temple History</h2>
            <p>On April 7, 2019, in his closing remarks for General Conference, President Russell M.
                Nelson
                announced that a second temple would be constructed in the nation of Honduras in the
                city of San
                Pedro Sula. There were eleven stakes organized in the metropolitan area of San Pedro
                Sula with
                additional stakes located in other areas of northern Honduras. Saints traveled over
                200 miles to the
                well-attended Tegucigalpa Honduras Temple to serve in the temple. Membership growth
                had been strong
                in this Central American nation where membership grew from 6,300 members in 1980 to
                178,200 members
                in 2019.1</p>
