                At Cangrejal Tours, our mission is to give you real adventure on the powerful
                Cangrejal River. We
                want every visitor to feel the rush of the rapids, the beauty of the jungle, and the
                excitement of
                exploring Honduras in a fun and safe way. Our local guides work hard to keep every
                trip full of
                energy, teamwork, and unforgettable moments. We believe adventure should be real,
                natural, and
                shared with people who love the outdoors as much as we do.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Rafting on the Cangrejal River began in the 1990s and early 2000s, when
            eco lodges and local tour companies first explored the river’s steep drops
            and big boulders. As adventure tourism grew, they developed guided rafting
            trips, and today the Cangrejal is known as one of the top white water
            destinations in Central America.
        </p>
        <p>
            As rafting became more established, the Cangrejal River Valley grew into a
            small adventure hub, attracting travelers from around the world. New lodges,
            certified guides, and improved access from La Ceiba helped the sport expand,
            turning the river into a year‑round destination for both beginners and
            thrill‑seekers. Today, rafting is one of the main reasons visitors come to
            the Cangrejal, combining excitement, nature, and local hospitality in one
            unforgettable experience.
